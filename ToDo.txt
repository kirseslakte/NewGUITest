WHEN CREATING VASSALS ONE MUST ASSIGN NAME TO THE VASSAL AND THE LORD OF THE VASSAL!!!!

there seems to be an issue with reading costs and upkeeps from add-ons into buildings. they are never added by themselves at start.

Buildings.update() does not include the built fortifications?<- that might be a problem

4. addVassal button should get some functionality... should be easy?

3. the nationpanel does not show the correct information...

2. when the nation is loaded, it requires an update before things actually registers as they should... check load procedure and exactly what updates actually does.

1. create routes window---DONE!

--officials are not loaded properly, but require a save-press before they work
--the eco variables are not loaded properly. 
--military/guilds upkeeps need to be textfields.
