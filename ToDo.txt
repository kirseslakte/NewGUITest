WHEN CREATING VASSALS ONE MUST ASSIGN NAME TO THE VASSAL AND THE LORD OF THE VASSAL!!!!

reading the input values on buildings into built_buildings,built_fortifications and so on seems to be working!
1. next step is to be able to read these strings and put them into the visuals.
2. after that we need to fix so that when we load the nation, hexes are loaded properly, and that the built_strings are loaded!
