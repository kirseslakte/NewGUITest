general:
construct the save/load methods so that they... *gasp* work!
when a new vassal is created make a new window, and simply make the 'inactive ones' invisible, so that their states can still be accessed.

rule-wize:
Add Buildings
Add Institutions
add culture&religion tables
add tradefunction
Add feats/unit feats&other unit related things

on mainthread:
fix loop so that all buttons have functionality---DONE!
tidy up the mainthread so that it is a bit easier to overview wtf is going on. MORE COMMENTS!---DONE!
set up a check to see if save_request? and then call NationHandler.properSave() or something
connect to nationhandler instead of mainwindow---save is handled from the nationhandler

NationHanler:
connect to the mainthread in a proper way.
initializer must set overlord window to visible and set that up properly
set up methods for showing (or unshowing) lord windows

LordWindow:
governmentpanel
nationstatspanel
culture/portfoliopanel
set up pages for vassaltree and notes
set up buttons (maybe nex to file?) for hexes, military, trade

on mainwindow:
add layouts so that we can actually start testing functionality
fix the save button so that we can start trying to read/write save files!

on nation:
total bpm, tax income, total trade value and overlord tax must be global and accessible, bake them into the nation object---DONE!

Add governemnt tab (already exists??)
These should not be on main window, but should possibly be sub-classes to main window, which all opens a small pop-up themselves.
Add Official functionality
Add trade
add hex things
add units
Add military things

priorities:
1. connect nationhandler to mainthread---DONE!
2. set initializers of nationhandler so that both lordwindow and hexwindow are created (probs mil/trade aswell)
3. create hex/mil/trade windows

NOTES:
Complete classes:
MainThread
These might also need some visual tweaking (but are still 'complete'):
MainMenu
LoadWindow
